📊 Hospital Analytics Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

The Hospital Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to provide key insights into hospital operations, patient care, and resource utilization. It helps healthcare professionals, administrators, and management teams monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and support data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

Monitor patient admissions, discharges, and occupancy rates

Track doctors’ and staff performance metrics

Analyze department-wise performance & patient outcomes

Provide insights into resource allocation (beds, equipment, staff)

Support hospital management in improving efficiency and patient care

📂 Dataset

The dashboard is built using healthcare-related datasets (hospital records). Typical data fields may include:

Patient demographics (age, gender, location)

Admission & discharge details

Department/ward utilization

Treatment and diagnosis codes

Staff & doctor allocation

Resource usage (beds, equipment, etc.)

🔒 Note: The dataset used in this report is for analysis purposes only and may be anonymized/simulated to ensure data privacy.

📈 Key Insights & KPIs

Admissions & Discharges Trend – Monthly/weekly patient flow

Bed Occupancy Rate – Utilization of available hospital capacity

Average Length of Stay – Patient stay duration analysis

Readmission Rate – Identifying potential quality of care issues

Department-wise Performance – Comparing specialties on key metrics

Resource Utilization – Tracking staff, equipment, and facility usage

📊 Visualizations

The Power BI report contains multiple pages with:

KPI Cards (quick metrics)

Line/Bar Charts (trends & comparisons)

Pie/Donut Charts (distributions)

Heatmaps (resource usage)

Interactive Filters (by department, time period, demographics)
